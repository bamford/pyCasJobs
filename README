# pyCasJobs module.

This module provides a class for accessing the SDSS CasJobs server in a programmatic manner.

Example usage:
>>> import pyCasJobs
>>> cas = pyCasJobs.CasJobs('username', 'password')
>>> cas.import_table('mytable.csv', 'mytable')

The current functionality is limited only to importing tables.
However, it should be straightforward to implement the additional elements of CasJobs,
such as SQL queries, in a similar manner.

Requires a non-standard library module: poster, see http://atlee.ca/software/poster/.
